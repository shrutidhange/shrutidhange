## Internship Work

1. Predictive Maintenance System for Turbo Engines
   - Feb 2023 - Aug 2023
   - The Predictive Maintenance System is designed to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of turbo engines to anticipate asset state, avoid downtime, and prevent breakdowns. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze sensor data from turbofan jet engines and provides real-time RUL predictions.
     
## Project Work

1. Melanoma Detection - Multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow
   - Mar 2023 - Jun 2023
   - Developed a CNN-based model to accurately detect melanoma, a type of deadly skin cancer. The model helps in reducing manual effort needed for diagnosis.

2. Customer Churn Prediction
   - Jan 2023 - Feb 2023
   - Predicted customer churn by performing data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, feature selection, model building, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning using Random Forest Classification and Logistic Regression.

3. Credit Risk Analysis
   - Sep 2022 - Oct 2022
   - Conducted risk analytics in banking and financial services to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

4. Prediction of Demand for Bike Sharing Application
   - Dec 2022 - Jan 2023
   - Developed a multiple linear regression model to predict demand for shared bikes. Employed feature selection, regression modeling, and model evaluation to assist management in understanding demand dynamics.
