## Project Work

1. Melanoma Detection - Multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow
   - Mar 2023 - Jun 2023
   - Developed a CNN-based model to accurately detect melanoma, a type of deadly skin cancer. The model helps in reducing manual effort needed for diagnosis.

2. Customer Churn Prediction
   - Jan 2023 - Feb 2023
   - Predicted customer churn by performing data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, feature selection, model building, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning using Random Forest Classification and Logistic Regression.

3. Credit Risk Analysis
   - Sep 2022 - Oct 2022
   - Conducted risk analytics in banking and financial services to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

4. Prediction of Demand for Bike Sharing Application
   - Dec 2022 - Jan 2023
   - Developed a multiple linear regression model to predict demand for shared bikes. Employed feature selection, regression modeling, and model evaluation to assist management in understanding demand dynamics.
